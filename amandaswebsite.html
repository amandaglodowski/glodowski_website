      A fixture of NYC, Amanda has called 3 of 5 boroughs home.
      She spent her collegiate summers working at her hometown paper, <i>The Brooklyn Reporter</i>, where she covered everything from politics to garbage pickups.
      She took a short hiatus from city life to study English rhetoric and economic policy analysis at Binghamton University.
      After graduation she worked for nearly four years as a research and analytics consultant for clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small, mission driven organizations.
      As a journalist, Amanda strives to leverage her expertise in data-driven narratives to tell stories through numbers.
